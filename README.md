## 🔒 Privacy

Privacy is core to the ClippyFM experience. We treat your clipboard data like it never leaves your device:

- All clipboard history stays locally on your Mac.
- We do not collect or transmit clipboard contents to any servers.
- Optional cloud sync (coming later) will be end-to-end encrypted and opt-in only.

If you have specific privacy questions, email aakashrohilla.work@gmail.com.
